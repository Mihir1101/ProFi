# How we used The Graph!

Our project needed data... A **LOT** of it! 
And there we had our *The Graph* at our rescue!

A part of the data we used to build & backtest our sweet algorithm was indexed using the [Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/profi/) we deployed.

We couldn't find an existing subgraph on the Graph explorer & so we created our own! Voila!
We did it for *Uniswap* pool. 

Anyways, it wasn't much pain because of the easeness & smoothness it offers to the developers for creating their owm subgraph.

The subgraph listens for events in the contract.
